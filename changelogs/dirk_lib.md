# UPDATE 1.3.0 | 26/08/2026

## Script Studio — one settings panel for every dirk script

Every script used to carry its own config menu. Same panel written over and
over, each one slightly different, each one needing its own command to find.
They are now one.

- **One panel, every script.** `/dirk_config` opens the lot. Each script keeps its own page, and your old per-script commands still work — they open the same panel on that script's page.
- **Search across everything.** Type "webhook" or "permit" and get matches from every installed script at once, jumping straight to the setting. Finding a setting no longer means remembering which script owns it.
- **One save bar.** Changes are collected and saved together, with a count of what you have touched and a way to put any of it back before saving. Nothing is written until you say so.
- **Maps instead of coordinates.** Anywhere a setting is a place, you get a map and a marker rather than three numbers to paste.
- **Pickers instead of typing.** Items, icons and peds are chosen from a list with their artwork, and a name you have not installed yet is flagged rather than silently accepted — so you can set gear up before the restart that adds it.

## Logs

- **Every dirk script now logs to one place**, readable in the panel and searchable by script, event, player or text. Nothing to set up: it is on by default and prunes itself.
- **Discord webhooks are now set up once, here, instead of per script.** Point a webhook at everything, at one script, or at particular events, and add as many as you like. Batched and rate-limited properly — a busy night sends a handful of messages rather than hundreds.
- Existing per-script webhook settings are read and carried over, so nothing needs re-entering.

## Bridges

- **A page showing what dirk_lib actually detected** — your framework, inventory, target, dispatch and the rest — and letting you override any of it when the guess is wrong. Previously this was invisible, and a wrong guess meant a support ticket.

## What's new

- **Releases and announcements now reach you in-game.** Changelogs are read in the panel, and are fetched fresh rather than being whatever shipped in the build, so you can see what an update contains before you take it.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.80 | 17/08/2026

## Fixes
- **Settings panel no longer opens empty for scripts with no server-only fields.** Every field read as blank and Save stayed greyed out, so the script's settings could not be edited at all. Scripts that *do* hide values from clients (fishing) were never affected, which is why this went unnoticed — it hit everything else, multichar included.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.79 | 07/08/2026

## Fixes
- **Settings are no longer deleted when a script's schema falls behind.** A saved value with no matching entry in the script's settings file was dropped on every restart — whole lists could disappear with only a debug line to say so. Values are now kept, and start being used again the moment the script declares them.
- **ESX money and account reads fixed.** Three qb-core shapes had been copied into the ESX bridge where they cannot work, so these were silently failing on every ESX server.

## Added
- **`lib.money.onChange`** — one event for a player's balance changing, on any framework, with a signed amount and the new total. ESX, QBCore, QBX and ND all report this differently (some send the change, some send the new balance, across three separate events); this normalises them into one.
- **`lib.player.getAccounts`** — every money account and its balance in one call, instead of looping over account names you had to know in advance.
- **`lib.player.getSourceFromIdentifier`** — a server id from an identifier, on any framework.
- **bp_inventory support.** Registered ahead of ox_inventory, since bp declares itself as ox and would otherwise be detected as the wrong inventory.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.78 | 17/07/2026

## Fixes — devix-inventory bridge
- **Usable items now register through devix-core's `UsableItem`**, so the handler receives the exact **slot + metadata** of the item being used. Fixes fishing rods (and other usable items) erroring with "cannot find slot on use" on devix — the framework-sync path wasn't reliably carrying the slot. (Reported by _i23.)
- **Item metadata now writes by slot** via devix's `UpdateSlotMetadata`, replacing the old serial-based write that only worked for weapons. Fixes item metadata/attachments (e.g. the fishing rod loadout) not persisting on devix.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.77 | 17/07/2026

## Fixes
- **Callback timers no longer linger.** Every `lib.callback` request scheduled a 5-minute timeout that was never cancelled once the callback answered (normally within milliseconds), leaving a growing backlog of dead timers on a busy server — and a request that never got a reply also leaked its tracking entry. Both are now cleaned up the instant a callback resolves.
- **SQL diagnostics fully stop when debug is turned off.** The debug hitch-monitor previously kept running until a full resource restart, even after `basic.debug` was switched back off. Its thread now exits completely the moment debug is disabled (and respawns if you turn it back on), so a server that isn't actively debugging has zero diagnostic threads. Only ever affected servers that had debug enabled.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.76 | 15/07/2026

## Fixes
- **Big join-time hitch removed.** The groups module ran a player lookup on every character load — profiled at up to **700ms per join** on a busy (350-slot) server, stacking into visible server hitches. It now exits instantly when no groups are active (the overwhelmingly common case). (Profiled + reported by reyesmtv.)

## Improvements
- **Lithuanian translation polished by a native speaker** — 106 strings improved. Ačiū, snaiperiukas!
- **Italiano (it) added to the language picker** — the `it` locale already shipped; now it's selectable from `/dirk_lib` → Basic → Language.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.75 | 10/07/2026

## New
- **Lithuanian (`lt`) added.** `/dirk_lib` → Basic → Language now lists **Lietuvių (lt)**, and a Lithuanian `locales/lt.json` ships with the library. It's a solid first pass rather than a native polish — corrections are very welcome.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.74 | 09/07/2026

## Fixes
- **A fresh install could leave every dirk script's config permanently dead.** On a brand-new database all your dirk resources boot at once, and each one tries to create the shared `dirk_scriptConfig` table. That `CREATE TABLE` was neither `IF NOT EXISTS` nor error-guarded, so whichever resources lost the race threw *"table already exists"*, silently killed their own scriptConfig init, and every client callback then failed with a cryptic `Callback <resource>:getScriptConfig timed out` — no peds, shops or zones, and an admin panel that loads forever and never saves. Table creation and the column migrations are now idempotent and error-guarded, so any number of resources can boot together safely.
- **If the table genuinely can't be created** (database user missing `CREATE` permission, unsupported DDL) **you now get a clear error saying exactly that**, naming the SQL problem and how to fix it — instead of silent death followed by timeout spam from every dirk script.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.73 | 09/07/2026

## New
- **Norwegian added to the language picker.** `/dirk_lib` → Basic → Language now lists **Norsk (no)** alongside the other languages, so you can select it from the panel instead of setting the convar by hand. Scripts that ship a `no` locale (e.g. dirk_fishing) then render in Norwegian.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.72 | 09/07/2026

## Fixes
- **Custom item images (ox `client.image`) now display instead of breaking.** When an item's `client.image` was a fully-qualified reference — a URL, an `nui://` path, a data URI or an absolute path — `lib.formatImagePath` still prefixed the CDN base and appended `.png`, producing a mangled URL and a broken image. Those are now used as-is, so custom item art shows everywhere dirk UIs render inventory images (stores, markets, guidebook, loadout, admin item pickers). Bare item names still resolve against your configured image path as before.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.71 | 09/07/2026

## Fixes
- **devix-inventory: client-side inventory reads now use the correct export.** The bridge was calling a guessed `GetInventory()` to read the local player's items (rod loadout, bait counts, `hasItem` checks) — an export devix doesn't provide, so on devix installs those reads came back empty. It now uses devix's actual **`GetPlayerItems()`** (confirmed with the devix developer), so client-side inventory checks work on devix.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.70 | 08/07/2026

## Fixes
- **`lib.inventory.canCarryItem` now works on ox_inventory and qs-inventory.** These two bridges were missing the capacity check, so any script that pre-flights "can the player carry this?" before taking payment (e.g. store purchases) silently skipped it — a player with a full inventory could be **charged without receiving the item**. Both now implement it (ox `CanCarryItem`, qs `CanCarryItem`), so purchase flows across every dirk script correctly block when there's no room.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.69 | 06/07/2026

A garage bridge, so scripts can store vehicles into any garage system with one call.

## New
- **`lib.garage.addVehicle(src, opts)`** — store a completed / purchased vehicle in a player's garage with a single call, on any framework + garage system. dirk_lib routes it to the detected garage system's bridge (for systems with their own storage) or the framework's vehicle store, using a **schema-aware insert** that only writes columns your `owned_vehicles` / `player_vehicles` table actually has. This kills the class of `Unknown column 'garage'` errors on setups whose vehicle table doesn't match a hard-coded insert — e.g. **ESX + jg-advancedgarages**, whose `owned_vehicles` has no `garage` column.
- **Garage auto-detection** now recognises `jg-advancedgarages`, `cd_garage`, `okokGarage`, `esx_garage` and `loaf_garage` alongside qb-garages / wasabi / renewed.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.68 | 05/07/2026

Item icons now resolve on a cold boot without a restart, and devix / older tgiann installs get the right image path automatically.

## Fixes
- **Item icons no longer need a resource restart to appear.** On a cold server start, if your inventory resource finished starting *after* dirk_lib (common — libraries are ensured early), the item image path was left on a fallback and stayed wrong until you manually restarted dirk_lib and the script using it — reported on core_inventory (fish-store icons blank until a restart). dirk_lib now re-checks once the inventory is actually up and pushes the corrected path to every script live, so icons resolve on first boot. An image path you've set yourself in `/dirk_config` is never overwritten by this.
- **devix_inventory icons.** The devix image path now points at `devix-inventory/html/img` (where devix keeps its icons) instead of the previous `html/images` guess, so devix item images load.

## Improvements
- **Older tgiann-inventory icons work out of the box.** Some tgiann builds keep their icons in a separate `inventory_images` resource rather than inside tgiann-inventory itself. dirk_lib now detects that resource and points item images at it automatically — no manual image-path override needed. (Newer tgiann is unaffected.)

---

# UPDATE 1.2.67 | 05/07/2026

## Improvements
- **Item descriptions are now surfaced to script NUIs.** The shared item list (used by config panels + item pickers) now includes each item's inventory `description` alongside its label, weight and image — so scripts can source item descriptions from your inventory instead of re-storing them in their own config. (ox_inventory.)

---

# UPDATE 1.2.66 | 03/07/2026

Localisation hardening.

## Fixes
- **Missing translations are no longer written back into locale files at runtime.** A dev-only "collect missing translations" mode could echo any untranslated key back to disk — churning locale files on boot and leaving `"Key": "Key"` placeholders baked into shipped translations, which then showed as raw-looking labels or blocked the English fallback. It's been removed entirely: a missing key now simply falls back to English, and locale files are only ever edited by hand.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.65 | 03/07/2026

Inventory-bridge fixes for tgiann, a new devix_inventory bridge, and a Traditional Chinese locale.

## Fixes
- **tgiann-inventory: usable items (e.g. fishing rods) now fire.** On inventories layered over ESX that don't hand ESX an item record, a used item arrived without its data and the use was silently skipped — so the item appeared to "do nothing". The ESX bridge now resolves the missing record through the active inventory bridge instead of bailing, so the use goes through. Kept generic — no hardcoded inventory in the framework layer.

## New
- **devix_inventory bridge.** Initial compatibility layer for devix_inventory (grid-based). Handles add/remove/read, resolves grid slots, and writes item metadata through devix's serial-keyed update path. devix is closed-source, so a couple of record-shape details still need confirming on a live install — treat this first pass accordingly.
- **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) locale.**

---

# UPDATE 1.2.63 | 26/06/2026

Logging backends beyond Discord, per-resource access control, and a lighter config panel.

### New features
- **Send logs to Grafana, Datadog or Fivemanage.** A new Logger tab in `/dirk_config` lets you pick a logging service (Loki / Grafana, Datadog or Fivemanage); any dirk script that logs — fishing included — then routes through it. Discord webhooks still work exactly as before, this sits alongside them. Service credentials are server-only and never sent to clients.
- **Per-resource access control.** Each script — and dirk_lib itself — now has its own Access tab controlling who, beyond server admins, can open and edit its live config, granted by job / gang / ACE group or by individual player. The old central override list has been removed in favour of this. Master admins (the `dirk_lib_master_group` convar, default `group.admin`) always have access and can't be locked out.

### Improvements
- **The Appearance tab is now "Theme"** — same settings, clearer name (matches the per-script theme tabs).
- **Lighter config-panel load.** The panel now hydrates from a single cached fetch handed to the interface, and admins pull only the server-only fields when they actually open it — less network traffic, and secrets never leave the server.
- **English fallback for untranslated strings.** A config label with no translation in the active language now falls back to English instead of showing the raw key.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.62 | 25/06/2026

### Fixes
- **Destroyed ped handles are never served from cache.** A cached ped handle is now validated before reuse, preventing a class of nil-ped errors after respawns or model swaps.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.61 | 24/06/2026

### Fixes
- **core_inventory: item images + fitted rod parts fixed.** The image path for core_inventory is now detected correctly (shop and loadout icons were blank) and item metadata is read from the right place client-side, so fitted rod parts (reel / line / hook) save properly. Any dirk script running on core_inventory benefits.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.60 | 23/06/2026

### Fixes
- **Framework bridge player accessors now fail safe.** `lib.player.identifier` / `.name` / `.gender` / `.phoneNumber` (and the other player getters) used to `assert` "Player does not exist" the moment they were called for a connecting / not-yet-loaded source. If that landed in a server callback during early join, the throw left the client's `lib.callback.await` hanging — which on some setups blocked op-multicharacter (new players couldn't create a character) and could crash an admin panel mid-join. They now return `nil` and let the caller degrade gracefully. Applied across the **qb-core, qbx_core and es_extended** bridges. **Any dirk script benefits — updating is recommended.**

- **ESX + tgiann-inventory: using a fishing rod (or any usable item) no longer throws a server error.** When tgiann fires a use event without an ESX-shaped item record, the bridge now bails gracefully (with a warning) instead of handing `nil` to the consumer.
- **qb-inventory: item metadata now persists per slot.** The bridge had no per-slot `setMetadata` (writes fell through to *player* metadata) and read item metadata from the wrong field — so fitted rod parts (reel/line/hook) silently failed to save. Both fixed; any dirk script storing item metadata on qb-inventory benefits.
- **`formatImagePath` no longer errors on a nameless item.** A nil/empty item name (e.g. surfacing in a FETCH_ALL_ITEMS lookup) now returns safely instead of crashing the item-list load.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.59 | 21/06/2026

### New inventory support — one_inventory
- **one_inventory (OneStudios) is now a supported inventory.** It's autodetected like every other system — no config needed — or you can pick it explicitly under Bridging in `/dirk_lib`. Item give/remove, stacking with metadata, slot lookups, item images, and per-slot metadata writes all work through it, so any dirk script that uses the inventory bridge (fishing included) runs on one_inventory out of the box.
- Usable items keep working via your framework's normal registration, and the item image path is detected automatically (override it under Bridging if you serve images from a CDN).

---

# UPDATE 1.2.58 | 19/06/2026

Config menu cleanup, a complete Spanish translation, and the diagnostics layer is now opt-in.

### Config menu — new "Basic" tab
- **Server name, language, currency, and a debug toggle now live in one "Basic" tab** at the top of `/dirk_lib`, replacing the separate Branding and Localization tabs. Existing values carry over automatically on first boot — nothing to re-enter.
- **Advanced** now holds just the primary-identifier setting.
- The inventory image path stays under Bridging (next to the inventory picker), and a custom URL there now properly overrides the auto-detected one.

### Diagnostics are now opt-in
- **The SQL/hitch diagnostics layer only runs when you enable Basic → Debug** (off by default). It was previously always-on; now it's zero-overhead unless you flip the toggle to capture a report.

### Discord settings page
- Bigger, easier show/hide toggle on the bot-token field, with proper spacing from the edge.
- The "how to create a bot" guide is shown inline instead of behind a dropdown, and the developer-portal link is more readable.

### Localization
- **Spanish (es) is now fully translated** — a large batch of strings that previously fell back to English have been completed.
- The config menu's left-hand tab labels now update instantly when you switch language (no restart needed).

### Under the hood (recent)
- Lighter startup: the script-config system skips its boot-time database write on a clean restart, and the shared config table is schema-checked once per boot instead of by every dirk resource.

# UPDATE 1.2.47 | 12/05/2026

### Hotfix — ox_inventory bridge `getItems` cleanup
- 1.2.46 swapped to `GetInventory(invId, true)`, but ox_inventory's second arg is `owner` (string|number), not a `full` flag — passing `true` is undefined on modern ox. Dropped the second arg. Items still come back the same way via `.items` on the returned OxInventory object. Strictly broader compatibility.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.46 | 12/05/2026

### Hotfix — ox_inventory bridge: wrong export name
- `lib.inventory.getItems(invId)` was calling `exports.ox_inventory:GetInventoryItems(invId)`. The export exists on modern ox_inventory, but ox-compatible inventories that re-declare `provides 'ox_inventory'` (e.g. ak47_inventory) emulate an older snapshot of the API and don't ship it — calling it there crashes with `No such export GetInventoryItems in resource ox_inventory`. Switched to `GetInventory(invId)` which has been in ox's API since day one and works on every version + emulation. Affects everywhere `lib.inventory.getItems` is used (fish markets, equipment stores, loadout, bait market, reward backfill).

---

# UPDATE 1.2.45 | 12/05/2026

### Hotfix — configurator crash on malformed inventory items
- `lib.formatImagePath` now safely returns `""` when called with `nil`/empty/non-string input, instead of crashing with `attempt to index a nil value (local 'name')`. The configurator could fail to open on servers whose inventory had at least one item registered without a `name` field — a custom or malformed entry was enough to break the whole items lookup.
- ox_inventory bridge: `items()` and `item()` now fall back to the item's table key when both `client.image` and `name` are missing, matching the defensive `or k`/`or name` pattern the other bridges already had.

---

# UPDATE 1.2.43 | 11/05/2026

Lib-side fixes from the dirk_fishing customer-ticket batch (jamazzz, jahm94, battlex2307), plus a new schema-driven install + missing-items pipeline. Pairs with dirk_fishing 2.0.26.

### Schema-driven install generation
- New `x-installItem` / `x-installItemList` schema annotations describe items the consumer needs registered. dirk_lib walks them after every scriptConfig load + change and writes `INSTALLATION/itemsToAdd/{ox.lua, qb.lua, esx.sql}` straight to the consumer's resource folder. Replaces hand-rolled per-resource install.lua files.
- ESX SQL output now matches the actual ESX legacy `items` table (`name, label, weight`) — the previous hand-rolled SQL declared a non-existent `description` column and would fail to import on some servers.

### Missing-items audit + banner
- New per-resource callback returns a list of items that are configured but not registered in the player's inventory, with ready-to-paste snippets for ox / qb / esx.
- Server console warning fires once on resource start (deferred 5s for inventory-bridge readiness): "N items missing from your inventory: …". Caps at 5 names + "and N more". Silent when nothing's missing.
- A missing-items banner auto-appears in the configurator above the tab list whenever items are missing — no consumer code required, just annotate the schema. Includes a refresh button; re-audits on save-success.

### Inventory lookups
- New `lib.inventory.item(name)` accessor — works on every inventory bridge.
- Audited every underlying inventory's actual exports. Native single-item fast-paths now wired for `ox_inventory`, `tgiann-inventory`, `ak47_inventory` and `dirk_inventory`. `qs-inventory` and `codem-inventory` have no native definition lookup, so they fall back to a cached-bulk read.
- Framework-level fast-paths added too: `qb-core`, `qbx_core` and `es_extended` now do direct shared-table indexing, skipping the bulk-fetch cache build entirely.
- Fixed an edge case where an inventory's own items table (e.g. qs-inventory's `shared/items.lua`) was being shadowed by the framework's. Resolution chain now uses the inventory's own table when it has one, before falling back to the framework's. No more "item exists in the inventory but the lookup says it doesn't".

### ESX bridge
- `getMoney` now nil-checks the account — returns 0 instead of crashing on `.money`-of-nil when an account is missing. (This was the source of battlex2307's permit-purchase crash on first install.)
- New `cash` ↔ `money` alias resolver shared across `getMoney` / `addMoney` / `removeMoney` / `setMoney`. If you ask for `cash` and the player only has `money` (or vice versa), the bridge resolves to whichever the player actually has — cross-framework consumers don't need to special-case ESX legacy's account naming.

### Security
- `schema.json` removed from `dirk_lib/fxmanifest.lua`'s `files{}` block. It was reachable via `nui://dirk_lib/schema.json` from any iframe. Server-side `LoadResourceFile` reads don't need that exposure — only NUI / asset manifests do.

### scriptConfig
- `<scriptName>:giveScriptConfigItem` callback now accepts an optional `metadata` payload that's passed through to `addItem`. Lets consumers include real catch metadata on items the admin spawns from the configurator, so the spawned item behaves identically to one earned naturally. Optional — no breaking change.

### Release pipeline
- Released zip now includes `schema.json`. The release workflow's bundled-files copy was missing it, so FiveM warned `could not find file 'schema.json'` on first boot for installs from the GitHub release (self-built copies were always fine).

---

# UPDATE 1.2.42 | 08/05/2026

### scriptConfig — permissions
- **Master-group convar takes a comma-separated list now.** Default `group.admin,admin,command` — whichever ACE your server.cfg actually grants, you'll match. Override `dirk_lib_master_group` with your own list (or single value) to lock it down. Avoids the long-running "I'm clearly admin but the editor says no permission" issue caused by every cfg granting different ACE values.
- **Save permission now matches the chooser-open permission.** Both go through the same authoritative `canEditScriptConfig` check (master ACE list + per-resource overrides). Before this, opens worked but saves silently failed with `NoPermission` for masters because the callback ran in the consumer's Lua VM and couldn't see the dirk_lib-internal access function.
- New export: **`exports.dirk_lib:canEditScriptConfig(src, resourceName)`** — bridges the cross-VM gap above. Any script consuming `lib.scriptConfig(...)` can also call this directly to check permission server-side.
- The `/dirk_config` chooser now logs (server-side) when a player is denied, including the master-group value it checked and the player's identifiers, so cfg mismatches are diagnosable instead of silent.

### scriptConfig — smartMerge
- **Fixed nested-array deletes silently coming back from defaults.** Inside an `x-arrayKey` array (e.g. `stores`), the matching of a default item with its DB version used `lib.table.merge`, whose third argument is `addDuplicateNumbers` — not the `overwrite` flag the calling code seemed to assume. The recursion into nested arrays merged by numeric index, so any indexes that existed in defaults but had been deleted in the DB came back on every load. Replaced with recursive `smartMerge`, which respects "DB is source of truth" for arrays.
- New helper `isArrayLike(t)` so smartMerge can correctly identify nested arrays even when no JSON-Schema item info is provided.

### Notes for consumers
- No API changes. Existing `lib.scriptConfig(schema, canEditFn, rules)` calls keep working — `canEditFn` becomes a fallback that runs only when the master/override check denies. Custom rules can grant additional access but cannot lock out the master.
